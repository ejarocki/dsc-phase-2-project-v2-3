    "# Overview and Business Understanding\n",
    "My stakeholder is Lynn Crane Real Estate. She wanted to identify trends within home sales in King County, Washington. There are many considerations when buying and selling a home that she must take into account. She wanted to know which attributes of a home are the most desirable (ie. yield the highest selling price). I used data from the King County House Sales dataset to create several models to determine which features affected price the most. "

Excessive deferred maintenance and abuse, limited value-in-use, approaching abandonment or major reconstruction; reuse or change in occupancy is imminent. Effective age is near the end of the scale regardless of the actual chronological age.\n",

All major components still functional and contributing toward an extended life expectancy. Effective age and utility is standard for like properties of its class and usage.\n",

Although it seems intuitive that more bedrooms would raise the price of the house, our data does not suggest that this is a significant factor.

The condition of the house, from 0-Poor to 5-Very Good, does not have a significantly impact on price either. \n",
